## Explanation of scripts and folders:
 - **GridEncoder**: Scripts used to obtain the models for each possible value of hyperparameters in the encoder NN
 - **GridDecoder**: Scripts used to obtain the models for each possible value of hyperparameters in the decoder NN
 - **AdHocDietsPredictions.ipynb**: Notebook in which we obtain the OTUs prediction for the keto, vegetarian and mediterrean diets that we created
 - **BestModelsFood.ipynb**: Script to obtain predictions, error per OTU and FI of best models with food information for every taxonomical rank
 - **BestModelsNutrients.ipynb**: Script to obtain predictions, error per OTU and FI of best models with nutrient information for every taxonomical rank
 - **CompleteBlanksInTaxonomyDictionary.r**: Script that fills some blanks in the complete name of OTUs, if possible
 - **FeatureSelectionFood.ipynb**: Script to perform feature reduction in food metadata
 - **FeatureSelectionNutrients.ipynb**: Script to perform feature reduction in nutrient metadata
 - **PreProcessingMetadata**: Script to remove extra information columns of the dataset and filter samples that did not have both metadata and microbiota data associated
 - **Transformation20CommonOTUs.ipynb**: Script to find common OTUs in Johnson and Bushman datasets
 - **script_error_per_OTU_mod.r**: Modification of script_error_per_OTU.r (in Src folder) to obtain the error per OTU of the predictions in models
